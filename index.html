                            To God be the glory. For He is good and His goodness
                            reigns forever. LORD I want to thank You for Your
                            patience and Your Love that You have shown upon me.
                            I cannot express how grateful I am. What you have
                            seen for my life, that is more than what I could
                            ever have planned with my limited understanding.
                            Thank you Jesus. I Love You.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been born to a beautiful Message Believing
                            wonderful Christian parents. I have 5 siblings I am
                            the third. By the grace of God, we all have received
                            Jesus Christ into our Life as our Personal
                            Saviour.My life had always been so different and
                            extraordinary as I see it. How He led me, and worked
                            in my life was so sweet and always filled with His
                            Love. After my graduation when I got my first job, I
                            never did realize God left me alone. There was
                            always someone like a mentor or a guardian God kept
                            in person to take care of me. But it was when I
                            moved to Mumbai at my second job that God dealt with
                            me. How I came into a beautiful fellowship with Him
                            when I was alone in my room and I used to commune
                            with Him. I see it how God dealt with Moses while 
                            taking His servant away from everyone to deal with
                            Him personally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Mumbai, it struck me when I had no-one physically
                            with me except few people around me, who helped me
                            through my day to day stuff.  But it was the
                            absolute quietness in my room when God dealt with me
                            to know Him and how I desired that I want to know
                            Him personally. No-one can fill His place in my
                            life. It's Him alone who is my First Love and by His
                            Grace and Love outpouring I can spend life with
                            every friend and family and people He brings my
                            way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a beautiful time when I spent time with God,
                            reading His Word, listening to his Voice, a
                            prayerful life, writing letters, fellowshipping with
                            my beautiful sister and her family every weekend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But when we get so close to Jesus so full of love
                            with Him like you Love Him so completely then comes
                            the testing time and the devil used my weakness, the
                            knowledge of good and evil to try out to go out and
                            see why there are so many good so-called Christians
                            doing good works and so in sweet love with everyone
                            they meet and especially in Message believing
                            churches such difference and hatred to not cooperate
                            even talk with people going to another church. Where
                            was that love spoken in the Bible when people in the
                            Message churches differentiated because of some
                            doctrines or some behaviour and laws and order of
                            church.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was hypocritical to understand all things and
                            much later was the question was brother Branham
                            truly a prophet sent of God. This doubt as the devil
                            puts, no matter what the truth, its the Truth of God
                            that sets you free. All this spiritual battle made
                            me so bitter to listen to any man's opinion but to
                            directly hear from God Himself. (Again God speaks
                            through man)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After my struggle and desire to know the Truth, God
                            one day gave me a beautiful dream of the Rapture,
                            that He is coming over a Cloud taking me Home while
                            all others whom He do not want is going straight to
                            a big ball of everlasting fire. It is such a scary
                            terrible place. But Praise God, He is never late. He
                            is always on Time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Back after my struggle with my battles , there came
                            the time when I got to actually continuously listen
                            and read through the Message Books and especially
                            the Supernatural Life of Brother Branham audiobook.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Brother Branham lived such a humble life, being so
                            blessed and powerfully used by God, yet always
                            visioned for the Glory of God to fulfill His
                            Works.His vision to prepare the Bride of Christ,
                            what a love story. Can there be another Love so pure
                            and so Holy but what God has for His Little Bride.
                            The more I ate the unadulterated Word, the more
                            confirmation and faith to be at the Word.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's such a great feeling to be in Love with Jesus
                            Christ and most importantly to know who you are,
                            what you are here for on earth, to be the LIGHT OF
                            THE WORLD, to be the SALT OF THE EARTH, TO LIVE THE
                            WORD, TO BE THE WORD BRIDE JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Christ we are Perfect. There is no goodness in
                            me, and yet when you give God your least, your
                            sincere desire to serve Him, He can use you
                            mightily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was my time in Mumbai, that it happened when the
                            covid struck and every part of the world just went
                            blank on how to function. Churches closed, shops and
                            transport lockdown, no food, no groceries, no means
                            to keep our jobs and security and most damaging to
                            not be able to have fellowship with fellow
                            believers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is just something about having fellowship with
                            Godly friends and family discussions when its just
                            Love outpouring, God Himself present amongst us
                            covering us in His embrace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was my birthday on the 17th of January, 2020 when
                            I deeply needed a purpose and confirmation from God
                            that He sees my desire to know Him and to be in use
                            for Him. Thats when He gave me the Scripture Ruth
                            2:12, which says - "The LORD recompense thy work,
                            and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of
                            Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust." I
                            know this was my personal moment with my God,
                            because He knew I trust Him with my everything. I
                            could either rely on my limited understanding and
                            try to fix everything which I know how terribly
                            would fail or I would trust my Lord Jesus Christ,
                            who is the Truth, the Way and the Life. He is the
                            Wisest of All. He is the Ancient of Days and He
                            loves me before the foundation of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People and situations can break my heart, my
                            feelings and emotions can twist my mind, but its
                            God's Unfailing Love that sustains me till the end.
                            Now after this verse and Promise from God, I had to
                            know what is my full reward which He promised to
                            give me. And during those times of covid outbreak
                            started the blessed youth without borders meetings
                            by Rapturing Faith Believers Fellowship family from
                            New Zealand and the subsequent streaming of past
                            youth meetings in Cloverdale Bibleway camps. The
                            believers from New Zealand, my family, my amazing
                            friends God gave me from different parts of the
                            world in the Bride and the ministers God used
                            tremendously with His gifts to speak to me
                            personally and directly for my situation I was in.
                            It was so personal and so alive every meeting. Its
                            such a presence like we were worshipping together
                            the Lord Jesus Christ so heavenly atmosphere and I
                            was present in that atmosphere. Just towards the end
                            of the year was the last service where the message
                            came on my full reward and it was God's Amazing love
                            for me. That was my full reward. He Loves me like no
                            other and He loves me so I am able to love others,
                            His Love changes me deeply and it is His Love again
                            that I trust and I know He wont let me down ever, He
                            wont let me be ashamed because I am His and He is
                            mine. How blessed to be chosen by Him. To know Him
                            is truly Life Eternal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And then the next year 2021, January 17 arrives with
                            yet another expectation from God. How wonderful are
                            His promises, when it teaches you to develop your
                            character after every victory of your old nature,
                            your old habits and here God promised me yet another
                            powerful Scripture from I peter 5:10 which reads
                            "But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto
                            His Eternal Glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye
                            have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish,
                            strengthen, settle you." That was so powerful for me
                            because of the to settle me. After my professional
                            life I knew God used my work and experience in so
                            powerful ways to reach out to people to be a good
                            listener to be a nice friend, to develop my nature
                            to understand and tolerate the differences among
                            different individuals and to truly live as a real
                            Christian where Christ is reflected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was truly a journey where God moved me from place
                            to place and then I know God would definitely want a
                            future for me to be settled in. But i know of my
                            imperfections and shortcomings. I know how I lack so
                            many things but its God who does what He wills and
                            here is where I somehow wondered where to next Lord.
                            Will you please take me to them where You want to
                            actively use me for Your Kingdom, where I am not
                            confused but where my heart goes with Your heart,
                            where my Will is not mine, but it becomes to fulfill
                            Your Perfect Will. And it was only God who when He
                            makes the Promise He will always fulfill no matter
                            how delayed it may seem in our eyes but its always
                            God's Perfect timing and He is always on Time. If
                            God does not answer you right quickly may be it is
                            How He wants to speak with you when you get alone
                            with Him to listen to His Voice and follow His
                            Leading and in whatever you do, do it all for the
                            Glory of God. It took one year for me almost but God
                            actually moved me to my dream country Canada where
                            there is snowfall, there is a way to express our
                            point of views on what we think or say, there is
                            respect to our opinions, there is no barging into
                            our privacy and most importantly where I would
                            always want to visit. God knows our heart and he
                            says, Delight in the Lord and He shall fulfill the
                            desires of your heart.

                            blessed me with going to Cloverdale Bibleway to meet
                            the brothers and sisters I used to stream on the
                            church website back in India. How I got help from

                            It is truly a testimony filled with gratitude for
                            its all God to exalt His Holy Name and Praise be to
                            His Holy Name forever. Whatever God does is for a
                            purpose, so I come with great expectations to what
                            the Lord has in store for me. He does not need me
                            and yet He wants me so I give Him full control of my
                            life and pray to be used by Him as He pleases.
                            Praise be to God. AMEN.
